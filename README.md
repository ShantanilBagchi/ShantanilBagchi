Hey! I'm Shantanil or as friends call me Neil! 👋🏻
I'm a storyteller at heart and seasoned research & analytics professional who loves solving problems and telling stories with data. I have aided organizations adopt data-driven decision-making solutions to improve businesses. One of my major quests has been to leverage data to find actionable insights and thus connect dollars to the business outcomes. I call myself a 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 as I believe in empowering every individual with Data-Literacy, thus I have played the role of a mentor as well.

🙂 A little about my personality: I am the type of person who will ask “𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗜 𝗱𝗼 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲?” when presented with a problem and will pitch in whenever needed to find out-of-the-box solutions to existing processes. I am energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see improvement. I strongly believe in giving back to society and uplift everyone around me.

😎 Keeping data science aside, I love to sketch in my free time.
